      <h2>The Influence of Music within my Life</h2>

      <p>
        In order to learn more about me, there's no way that I couldn't include
        the topic of music. Raised in the Deep South by black parents, Gospel,
        RnB, Disco, and Soul music became a part of my being from an early age.
        In addition to this, the babysitter who used to take care of my sister
        and I in elementary school listened only to Hard Rock and Metal music,
        adding another two genres to my musical pallette. As I grew older and
        older, my music taste varied and changed, however, one thing stayed
        consistent throughtout these phases: the effect music has always had on
        me. For years, I have always used music to calm my anxiety down, uplift
        my mood, make me cry, complete assignments to, and any other scenario
        you can think of in the world. It's been there for me when friends and
        family never were, it's helped me through some of the hardest times in
        my life, and I don't think I could continue living if I was never able
        to hear music ever again. I want to share this passion and love of music
        with you, so here are a few of my favorite songs that I listen to
        depending on my mood or activity. Enjoy! :)
