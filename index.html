      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
      Hi! My name is Takara Askew (TUH-care-ruh ask-YOU). I am currently 21 and go
      by she/her pronouns. As a 4th year at the Illiois Institute of Technology, I
      am majoring in Global Studies and minoring in Information Technology and
      Management. I am originally from Memphis, Tennesse, however, after my
      parents' recent seperation, my mom, sister, and nephews moved down to
      Orlando, Florida. I spend most of my time in Chicago, Illinois though in
      order to attend my college. Career-wise, I am split between two distinctive
      fields: International Security or Public Policy. Due to this, I am primarily
      searching for internships or job opportunities in both so that I can try to
      decide what direction I should go in. However, I am hoping to go to Graduate
      School as well, so I do have a few years before I have to offically decide.
